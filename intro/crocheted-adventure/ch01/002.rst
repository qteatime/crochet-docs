Light the way!
==============

"So our problem right now is that the Torch System is not working,"
Sellaris explains again, you see Crochet nod, but you still don't
get what a 'Torch system' is---you can see that something isn't
working, though.

"This..." you try to explain your confusion. "This 'Torch System',
what exactly is it? I've seen torches before, and generally they
just took a bit of fire to work."

"It's called 'The Torch System', but they're not really your usual
torches. You can't just set them on fire---you can't even reach them.
They're all behind these glass domes that are supposed to keep the
oxygen flowing there or something," Sellaris starts. You brace
yourself for the long explanation.

"So in order to light them, they came up with this computer program
called the 'Torch System'. A lot of the things here in the Spire are
controlled by computers, in fact. Don't ask me why," you can hear
a hint of pain in Sellaris' voice, and you feel like, in some sense,
you could relate to it.

"The Torch System runs continuously here to keep all torches alight.
But sometimes it stops working. I've called for repairs before, but
they keep telling me they're on vacation, that the Spire isn't
'critical infrastructure'. All of that stuff. It's hopeless."

You couldn't blame the Spire's support people. Vacations were important.
And it's not like the Spire being out of order would really cause that many 
issues to people's every day lives. On the other hand, the glittering
hook illuminated enough of Sellaris' face for you to notice their
intent gaze at you, an expectant smile on their face. You had a
bad feeling about this.

"Which takes us to now," Sellaris goes on. "Since we're all here, we
can just try and fix the Torch System once and for all!" They proclaim,
proudly, hands in the air. An excitement that is not shared by poor
Crochet beside them.

Sellaris gently pokes Crochet on the shoulder, trying to encourage
her to talk. The pink-haired girl sighs. "I...," her voice trails off
the first time around. She tries again. "I remember the Adventuring
Starter Pack having a small simulation of the torch system. We could
try experimenting with that one before we tackle the real one?"

"Oh!" It's Sellaris' loud voice again that you hear. "That's a great
idea! I knew calling you here was the right thing to do." The gatekeeper
has a big smile on their face. "Maybe we should try running it first.
Do you know how to bring up Crochet's playground?"

You didn't have the slightest idea of what her playground was. Let alone
know how to bring it up. "You'll have to be more specific than that. She
has a playground?!"

"Oh, no worries," Sellaris dials down their hyper energy a bit again.
"Some other texts call it a repel...? A ripple...? A..."

"A REPL," Crochet intervenes.

"A REPL! That one! Crochet calls it a playground, which I think is the
cuter name anyway. You can bring it with a Terminal incantation again.
I'll say the words, you work your hook to get the magic flowing. Be
sure to do it from the Adventuring Starter Pack's domain."

You watch Sellaris' mouth move, the sound reaches you loud and clear:
