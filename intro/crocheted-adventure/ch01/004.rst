I Command Thee!
===============

"So," you look at the little ball of effusiveness at your side, wondering
if Sellaris' eyes are ever not-sparkling. "what exactly do you mean by
'more clever programming'?"

"Ah, see," they start, putting their hands together. You get the impression
they regret their choice of words. "What I mean is that we've been dealing
with just one thing at a time so far, but now we need to deal with many
things at once---even though there'll be only the red power cell in the set."

You nod, Sellaris continues. "But I don't think I needed to make that big
of a deal out of it," they punctuate with an awkward chuckle. "Anyway.
We can remove cells from the power grid with the ``power-grid take-out: power-cell``
command, but since we have potentially many of them, we'll need to do this
for each of the drained cells."

"Well, I say that," they continue, "but the program you need to write sort
of just spells what I just said anyway?"

::

    for Cell in simulation torch-system power-grid drained-cells do
      simulation torch-system power-grid take-out: Cell;
    end

"Oh!" Sellaris exclaims after looking at the output in the screen. "That's
a bit of an unfortunate result." You watch them rest their chin on their hand,
not saying much else. At least until they notice the puzzled look on
your face. "See where it says '#set in crochet.core', and then it shows a
grid with three cells, but no red power cell?" You look at the output Sellaris
is pointing at. "That's what the power grid looks after we've taken the cell
out. Which is alright. But if we had multiple drained cells it would show
the grid multiple times, just with its final state. It can be hard to
think about the way these outputs compose when you're coming up with them."

You think you get what Sellaris is saying. Sometimes you build something
with a particular goal in mind, and then someone else takes that and puts
it in a context you never thought about before. There's no telling what
could happen in those cases. Like when you use a pencil to hold your
hair bun---it might work, but it's certainly not the kind of use that
people who made the pencil had in mind.

"But, well, we can take a look at the power grid now to see if everything
looks good."

::

    simulation torch-system power-grid;

You run the program snippet in the playground. Out comes a new representation
of the grid's health, this time with no red---or drained---cells. Sellaris
looks pleased, and about to go on another rambling session.

"Hey," you interrupt them just in case. "Should we try running it to see
what happens?"

Sellaris' eyes moves from you to Crochet. The girl with pink hair seems a
bit at a loss for what to say. She ponders for a few moments. "I don't
think there's any harm in that, at least. It's just a simulation. If it
doesn't work I guess we'll get a new error message to chase."

"Let's run it again, then!" Sellaris' loud voice reaches your ears. You try
to remember the command you first ran, stealing some glances at the expectant
gatekeeper beside you. It takes a few moments for it to resurface::

    simulation torch-system start;
