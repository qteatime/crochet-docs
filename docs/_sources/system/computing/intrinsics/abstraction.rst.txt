Abstraction and execution models
================================

Computations in Crochet are executed immediately, but sometimes
this isn't desirable. For example, consider the cases where we
want to provide a way for people to decide which items they want
from a collection. They could specify the criteria with a Crochet
program, but they'd need a way of providing this program to the
collection somehow; that's where abstractions come in.


How is crochet executed?
