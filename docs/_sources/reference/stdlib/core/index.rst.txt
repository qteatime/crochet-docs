   :synopsis: The basic building blocks of Crochet.
   :platform: Node, Browser

The Core package provides the most basic features that a Crochet
program could want. It's very likely that your program will depend
on the Core package---and it is the reason why this package is
open by default, without requiring an ``open crochet.core`` declaration.

Core does not try to do everything, however---several of the features
introduced by core *will* be extended by other packages for more
specific use cases. For example, more complex text handling is
provided by the ``crochet.text.*`` packages.
