Standard Packages Reference
===========================

.. warning::

   All packages in the Crochet standard distribution are currently
   experimental. Everything here may change without much previous
   notice or support.

Crochet's standard distribution provides several packages out of the
box to make the system productive for users who just want to get
their creative projects done, without having to invent weird
computing concepts in the process.

This book provides a conceptual and example-based reference of the
contents of these packages. It's organised by categories.
