And things in this package will likely be\nmoved around and renamed as a result, before the stable release happens.\n\n# Predictable randomness\n\nThe [type:random] type provides the entry-point for predictable\nrandom number generation. All random number generators spawned\nfrom this type follow the [trait:predictable-rng] trait, but the\nonly concrete implementation is currently on the [type:xor-shift]\ntype.\n\nRandom number generators are **immutable** by default. That is,\ncalling methods on them does not _change_ the state of the generator,\nbut rather returns a [type:random-next] value with a new generator to use.\nThis leads to a pattern of usage that looks like the following:\n\n    let Random1 = #random with-seed: 123456;\n    let Result1 = Random1 between: 1 and: 10;\n    let N1 = Result1 value;\n\n    let Result2 = Result1 random between: 1 and: 10;\n    let N2 = Result2 value;\n\nNote how it's necessary to use the [command:_ value] command to extract\nthe actual integer generated by the random number generator. And in order\nto get a new result out of it, we have to use the [command:_ random] command\non the value we get back. If we had just used `Random1` to get generate\nthe second integer we'd get the same number as before—over and over\nagain—because we would run the generator with the same state.\n\n## Mutable generators\n\nAs a convenience, mutable generators are provided in the [type:mutable-random].\nThis can be constructed by using the [command:_ mutable] on any immutable\nrandom number generator. And the way it works is by wrapping the given\ngenerator in a type that keeps state with a mutable [type:cell], so every\ntime a command is used, the internal state is updated accordingly, affecting\nfuture generations of the value.\n\nWith mutable generators, the previous example can be written as:\n\n    let Random = #random with-seed: 123456 | mutable;\n    let N1 = Random between: 1 and: 10;\n    let N2 = Random between: 1 and: 10;\n\n\"Much easier!\", you exclaim. And indeed! However, care needs to be taken\nhere—if this mutable generator is shared with other pieces of code, then\nit can be _changed_ in ways that you did not expect, leading to a random\nnumber generator that is **unpredictable**. You generally want to avoid\nthis in simulations and games.\n\n## Scoped, shared generators\n\nFinally, this package also allows one to share mutable generators within\na dynamic scope—that is, instead of passing the generators around as\narguments to commands, you can share it once and access it everywhere\nwithin the code block it's shared with.\n\nBecause this risks the same unpredictable problems as before, but in\nan even greater scale, this package gates this power through two\ncapabilities:\n\n- [capability:update-shared-instance] allows one to override the\n  current scoped random generator (including changing its implementation!).\n\n- [capability:read-shared-instance] allows one to access the current\n  scoped random generator, and mutate it as a result of requesting new\n  random numbers.\n\nShared generators are safer than passing mutable generators around\nif you need to pass the generators to pieces of code that you don't\ncontrol, but these capabilities are best left granted **only** to your\napplication, unless you have a really good reason to grant it to\nanother package.\n\nUsing the shared generators looks like this:\n\n    let Starting-random = #random with-seed: 123456;\n\n    scoped-random with-source: Starting-random do: {\n      let Random = shared-random instance;\n      let N1 = Random between: 1 and: 10;\n      let N2 = Random between: 1 and: 10;\n    };\n"},"types":[{"full_name":"crochet.core/taint","name":"taint","static_full_name":"crochet.core/#taint","signature":"crochet.core/taint","documentation":"Allows converting trusted values to untrusted values.","is_sealed":true,"is_static":false,"module":"source/0-types.crochet","package":"crochet.core","fields":[],"parents":["crochet.core/any"],"traits":[],"capabilities":["crochet.core/tainting"],"subtypes":[],"declaration":"// -- The tainters\n\n/// Allows converting trusted values to untrusted values.\nsingleton taint;","location":"module source/0-types.crochet in crochet.core"},{"full_name":"crochet.core/untaint","name":"untaint","static_full_name":"crochet.core/#untaint","signature":"crochet.core/untaint","documentation":"Allows converting untrusted values to trusted values.\n\nThis type is particularly dangerous.
