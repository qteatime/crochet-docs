Surface Crochet
---------------

Surface Crochet---often referred to as just "Crochet"---is the main
programming language used in the Crochet ecosystem. It builds upon the
ideas from the Functional Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, and
Logical Programming communities, as well as ideas from classic artificial
intelligence, programming for videogames, and software verification. As
much as possible, it tries to package these ideas into a small set of
concepts with a friendlier surface syntax for beginner (and possibly
non-native English speaking) programmers.
