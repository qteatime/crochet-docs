The Crochet languages
=====================

Crochet is a programming system comprised of many different programming
languages. One could say that Crochet follows a "language-driven"
development philosophy, though we don't really limit ourselves to the
common idea that a "programming language" has to imply certain
representations or computational models.

This section of the reference describes each of the languages in the
system, in depth. It includes their design philosophy, tooling support,
and language concepts. Annexes with formal specifications are included
where it makes sense.
