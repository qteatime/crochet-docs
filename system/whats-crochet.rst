What's Crochet?
===============

Crochet is a tool for creating and remixing interactive
media: applications, games, interactive books, animations,
and so on. This is generally called a "programming system".

What differentiate Crochet from other programming systems
is that it tries very hard to make the experience of using
it as safe and privacy-respecting as possible. Even if you
download random pieces of code from the internet and include
in your own application. Even if you run a game some stranger
has sent you on social media. Even if you're not very familiar
with computer security. Even if you have absolutely no idea
of what you're doing.

One of the core principles of Crochet is that you should *feel*
safe to experiment with your computer as much as you want,
without having to worry about questions like: "If I install
this application, will it try to steal my files?" or "What if
I try this and it breaks my computer?"

There's nothing particularly *wrong* with wondering about these
questions. But life is a lot better if you don't *need* to worry
about them, because the tool you're using tries to give you a
safe environment for experimentation. Crochet aims to be that
kind of tool.


What is a programming system?
-----------------------------

So I mentioned that Crochet is a "programming system". But what
does that mean, really?

Well, "to program" something means that we create something
that the computer can understand. This is generally going to
be some kind of interactive application, like a game or an
interactive book. But interactivity isn't always necessary or
wanted. We might want to create digital media that has no
user interaction: like mixing a digital comic book with
sounds and some animation. Or even something like a visual
novel with no choices.

Sure, some of these could well be a movie. They could be created
in a video editor program. Crochet just gives you a different
tool to approach this kind of creation, which might or might not
be more interesting for you. That said, this book and other
Crochet materials focus more on *interactive* media, since
that's the point where you usually need to reach out for a
programming tool.

But what does it mean for it to be a "system"?

This one is a bit trickier. I did mention that Crochet is
"a tool". But more accurately, Crochet is really "a set of
tools". Just like office suites come with several different
tools that may complement each other. Crochet is the same.
Each tool has one different purpose in the creation of
interactive media.

This "set of tools" becomes a "system" by making them work
together rather seamlessly. The tools are *meant* to work
together. You might find yourself generating dialogues with
Surface Crochet, then using this dialogue in an interactive
fiction you wrote in Novella, and you test and develop the
game within Purr.

Surface Crochet, Novella, and Purr are some of the tools
you will find in the Crochet system. And anything you
create will likely use many of them. But that doesn't mean
you need to learn everything about these tools in order to
get anything done---indeed, some times you might not even
realise you're using a different tool, because they're all
part of the system. And they all support some specific
creation workflows. And these workflows will most likely
use only part of the tool.

You learn and think in terms of these workflows, rather than
the individual tools themselves. Most of the time.
