Foreign interfaces
==================

Sometimes Crochet does not provide enough to build the program 
you need. Maybe you have specific performance needs, or maybe
you want to use something that was built for another programming
platform. In these cases, Crochet offers a Foreign Interface mechanism
to interact with external programs.

Currently, foreign programs are limited to JavaScript.
